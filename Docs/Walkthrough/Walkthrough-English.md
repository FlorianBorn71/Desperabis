## Part 1 - The Crystal Ball

### Level 1 - The Park

Keys must be found in the hedge maze to open the gates. One gate opens access to another key hiding place. Beware of the snakes and other small animals. But first you have to get the scythe, which you can and must use to get through *small* hedges. A key is also hidden in a knothole on the large tree (climb up the ladder). After some back and forth you leave the labyrinth and find yourself at a well. Behind the hedge by the well is a switch that you can use to switch on the well. Then go to the fenced-off pasture, which has a gate and where a belligerent bull is waiting. You have to avoid the bull (you can't defeat him) and take the bucket with you. Fill up the bucket at the fountain (simply walk through the fountain with the bucket in your hand) and walk with the filled bucket to the dead tree with the gate in it. A few steps in front of this tree, the earth is slightly churned up, as the switch that opens the gate is buried there. This is exactly where you need to pour out the water to uncover the switch. Complete the level through the gate in the tree.

### Level 2 - Under Ground

You are in an underground passage that you follow until you reach a large room. Several actions must be carried out here:

#### Action 1:
Climb up the ladder (left) and quickly pull the switch at the top. This will lower a suspension bridge.

#### Action 2:
To the left of the ladder, open the switch to the door and follow the corridor. Enter the engine room and set the large pistons in motion with the switch on the right. Now quickly follow the oscillating movements to the other end. You can't go back! At the other end, pull both switches to open the next door. There is a boiler in the next room. Use the lever to close the valve and the boiler will explode after a few seconds. You should then be a safe distance away, as the oil on the floor will also start to burn. After a while, you can enter the room and exit through the hole that has been created. Slide into the water, dive through the opening opposite and keep away from the large fish. The easiest way is to pull the plug in the alcove to the right of the entrance :-). On the left in the corner of the room by the skeleton is a switch that releases the wooden fitting in the passage upwards. After you have left the water again, you are back in the passage from the beginning.

#### Action 3:
Now the drilling device and the "lift" have been set in motion in the large room. You can get one level higher by using the up and down movement of the lift by moving the platform sideways at the right moment. At the top, pull the hanging rope at the end of the suspension bridge, which raises a flap on the same level through which you reach another lever, which in turn lowers a bridge on the other side of the drilling device. Now you have to move along with the drill arms below to get to the other side. There is a lever there that creates a staircase. Use the stairs and the suspension bridge to exit the level at the ladder leading further up.

### Level 3 - Underwater Station

First, enjoy the view through the windows :-) In one corner there is a metal rod that fits into the switch by the door. Put the two together and the door will open. At the end of the corridor you enter the submarine, which you set in motion. You steer the submarine by looking slightly in one direction, pressing the action button (ENTER) and pulling one of the directional levers accordingly. Now you have to manoeuvre the submarine to the underground castle entrance without crashing into rocks too often. The path is complicated but marked by a few buoys. Shortly before the castle entrance, you have to dive through the passage that leads under the seabed. The cave entrance is also marked by two buoys. This opens the castle gate. This is also where the journey and the level ends.

### Level 4 - The Castle (1)

In the castle, open one of the wooden doors and take one of the coffins. Take the coffin into the room with the metal spikes on the ceiling and place it there. Now you can pull the lever in the room and leave the room in time, because the spikes are blocked by the coffin. The next door has opened. In the stairwell, take the torch from the first knight, continue up the stairs, pull the lever, avoid the wall and light the torch on the burning torch of one of the knights. Take the burning torch back down to the passage with the oil. Place the burning torch in the oil, which ignites and burns down. After a short time, you can enter the water and pull the lever at the end of the sewer. The lever releases a niche in the room above, in which a key to the door lies opposite. You are now in a stairwell. At the top is a winch that can be used to lower the basket containing the key. You have to turn the winch until the basket is a few stairs further down, directly in front of the window (try it out!). Use the key to exit the level through the door at the top.

### Level 5 - The Castle Roof

You are now at the top of the roof. Don't fall off the outside! Once inside, you can enter the ring-shaped corridor through a door. There is a key in a rest (watch out for bugs!). Go back outside and open the other door outside. The three levers must be pulled simultaneously for the next door to open. To do this, you have to pull them in the right order because they reset at different speeds. At the end of the open corridor is another chest with a key. You have to go back outside to the other side. There you can open the door and take the next key from the chest and the long metal bar in the next room. Go through the next door past the spikes and take the key. On the other side, open the last door (be careful to avoid the trap!) and climb through the hatch onto the roof. There, use the rope bridge to enter the roof of the middle building and place the metal pole in the socket in the centre and snap it into place. Then raise the pole with ENTER. Keep your distance, because a few seconds later lightning will strike. You can drop inside through the hole. Complete the level through the hatch inside.

### Level 6 - The Castle (2)

In the first room, push the stone slab aside and take the bones (4 of them). In the next room, use the lever to open the door to the dog kennel and enter it carefully. Place a bone in front of the attacking mutts in good time. In the kennel, pull a lever and take the bag of lentils with you. You can scatter these all over the place, which is very helpful to make the invisible bridge over the lava visible piece by piece. After crossing the lava via a few detours, you first enter a room with two millstones and then a large dark room. Here you pull the lever to switch on the lamp with the focussed light. There is a mirror in the corner, which you must take with you and position in the light path so that the light is reflected onto the red crystal next to the locked door. At the end of the corridor, pull the lever that sets the millstones in motion and go down the stairs to take the vase with you (careful, trap!). Take the vase to the millstones and place it there to destroy it. Use the key from the vase to complete the level.

### Level 7 - The Castle (3)

In the first room, dodge the knight's crossbow shot. In the next room there are 15 floor tiles with Roman numerals which you have to slide into the correct order (starting with I,II,III,IV,...,XV). This can be a bit tedious without a strategy, as there is only one free space at a time. Once you have made it, the centre door opens and you follow the stairs. At the top, go left and then into the first door. There is a book in the small study, which you should look at carefully with ENTER and memorise the number combination. There is also a book sticking out of the bookshelf, which you press as a switch. Now the rear door is also open and you take the "film" with you. There is also a key on the shelf. The door opposite the staircase can now be opened. Set the number combination from the book on the 4 wheels and the next door will open. Set the time to 12:00 on the grandfather clock and then quickly run along with the knights. There is a key in the clockwork and a lever to restart the clockwork. Now you can follow the wide corridor and have to avoid the fire. The foil makes the fire visible! At the end of the wide corridor, you can open the door and leave the level (almost) immediately. Before doing so, you must avoid the falling stones. A short cutscene follows and the first part of the game is over.
 
## Part 2 - The Rescue Of Grant

### Level 1 - The abandoned Village

There are no enemies in level 1, but there are weapons! Firstly, you should get the key for the hut. It is located at the top of the right-hand wall by the lock behind the lake. Use this key to get into the hut you started in front of. In the hut you can take with you: 2 arrows and a rat trap (very useful!). There is also a stone between the houses.

### Level 2 - In the Castle (1)

It is best to go straight through the door and down the corridor to the right without stopping. At the end of the corridor, go straight ahead through the door into a small room and take the dagger and arrow. There is some useful stuff in the other rooms (e.g. a map), but it is also dangerous...
You can walk over the cockroaches without taking any damage, just don't stand still! Go back down the corridor and kill a skeleton with the dagger and take the sword with you. Avoid the skeletons if possible and go into the newly created room. There you will find a key and some medicine. Follow the corridors again and use the left door in the next room with the skeletons. (The door straight ahead leads to the starting room). The next door can only be opened if you have the key. Go straight down the stairs and complete the level.

### Level 3 - In the Castle (2)

In this level you go from room to room and collect keys to get to the next room. In two rooms there are switches on the wall that need to be pressed to open the last door.
It is somewhat difficult to find the secret passage where the crossbow is located. However, the passage is marked on the map hanging on the wall in the large room. (Go to the map and press RETURN). You can recognise secret passages on a map by the fact that a wall is marked, but the passage continues directly behind it...
In the secret passage on the right, dive into the sewers and take the crossbow and medicine with you. If you shoot arrows, you can collect them again afterwards.
You can only use the dagger underwater.

### Level 4 - In the Castle (3)

When you leave the small room, you will find yourself in a large vaulted room. There are 5 chambers inside the vaulted room. You have to open the 4 outer chambers and pull the lever to open the exit - the centre chamber. You can keep track of the chambers that have already been opened by collecting the map. The glowing red bottle contains fireballs - the most powerful, but also the most valuable weapon.
Trick: There is a leaking oil drum in one corner. You can lure the spiders into the corner and ignite the oil with a fire shot...

### Level 5 - In the Castle (4)

The aim of this level is to pull the 4 switches distributed throughout the level to open the exit. An interesting but also dangerous detour is the secret passage, which is also marked on the map in the starting room. But it's worth it, because you can find the fireballs there.

### Level 6 - Fighting the Dragon

The dragon can (almost) only be defeated with fireballs. The number of fireballs in the level is relatively limited. You should therefore aim well!
There are secret passages between the torches. The fireballs are hidden in the long secret passage, but be careful, there are traps in the passage.
You can trick the dragon by crossing a side passage and catching the dragon waiting in front of the entrance from the side. Without these tricks, you will have a hard time against the dragon, as it is quite intelligent (for a dragon).
When the dragon sinks to the ground, keep your distance and collect the key after the explosion. This will take you to the exit.

### Level 7 - In the Woods

In the forest, you first have to go to the river to open the sluice. The flowing water will extinguish the lava at the other end of the forest. Once you reach the other end, you can now cross the riverbed and plunge into the volcanic crater. Sounds like little work, but the path is full of dangers...

### Level 8 - Limestone Cave (1)

First take the only possible route - down the cave to the underground lake. Be careful, it's teeming with sharks! Cross the lake, exit on the other side and continue along the cave. There is a lever on the right-hand side. Pull it, quickly disappear back round the corner and wait until the stones have rolled past. Continue along the cave to the room with the three corridors. First pull the levers in the outer ones, then the door in the centre will open. Use the key to get through the locked door. From now on, avoid the spiders and find the exit at the end of the many rooms...

### Level 9 - Limestone Cave (2)

Go through the left of the two doors, then turn right and pull the lever: The stone rolls away and clears the entrance.

Tip: Walk briefly to the stone and then pull the lever; the cockroaches fall down and are rolled over by the stone.

Enter the room with the bridge and take the conductor ball on the left. This is a good way to kill the flying cockroaches. Cross the bridge and take the key at the end of the corridor. Return to the starting room and go through the other door. Go through the corridor system and look for the place with the fire-breathing pipes. There you will find the next key. This will open the door to a room divided into two parts, where a giant anaconda is waiting. There you will find the key to the exit and you can also recharge the conductor ball at the box with the ball. (Keep your distance!)
Unlock the next door and take the lift out of the cave.

### Level 10 - The Witch

Enter the house of a mysterious witch through the lift shaft. Here you can exchange the gold you have collected for goods. The arrow poison is interesting: if you have it, you can shoot poisoned arrows with your crossbow, which will permanently drain the energy of enemies if you hit them. Finish the level by going straight through the door.

### Level 11 - The Cementery

Go down the stairs and turn left to the hut in the cornfields. There is a shovel hanging on the wall in the hut. You can use the shovel to dig wherever there is a small mound of earth. The key to the cemetery was buried with the cemetery gardener at the edge of the cornfield behind the fence. The fence must first be knocked down. The cemetery gate can be opened with the key. There are also some things buried here: e.g. medicine and the key that opens the gate to the cathedral...


### Level 12 - The Cathedral

First follow the side passage and at the end step in front of the wall on the left and press RETURN: The wall is a door. There are 2 small rooms to pass through. There is a switch at the end. As soon as the switch is pressed, you will be followed by ghosts that are only visible in the immediate vicinity and cause a lot of damage. You cannot defeat them with weapons, but you can lure them into the passage at the side (hidden behind a door), into which a ray of dawn light falls. If the ghosts come into contact with the light, they die quite spectacularly!

Now go back to the starting point and the door to the cathedral will have opened. If you haven't found a crossbow yet, there's one lying around here, as well as an arrow. You now need the crossbow to get further. If you press the switch at the head of the cathedral, a stone will slide to the side behind you, but not far enough to reach it. As you can guess, you have to stand in front of the stone and shoot at the switch with the crossbow (aim well!).

Continue in the water. Dive quickly and turn right before the gate (the skeleton points in the right direction :-) ). Fight the moray eel with the dagger - the only weapon you can use underwater - and take the key with you. Now you can open the gate under water...
Follow the passage, take fireballs with you, and in the room at the end immediately shoot at the gully with fire, then no spiders will come out. Pull the switches (3 in total) and leave the room again. A door has opened on the right, through which you can end the level.

### Level 13 - The Sewers (1)

First follow the passage on the right, take the key at the end, go back to the beginning, unlock the gate and go through to the end. Very easy!

### Level 14 - The Sewers (2)

In the first alcove on the right, press the horizontal switch to start the mill. Now go into the large central room with the many doors and go straight ahead into the room with the millstones. Cross the room carefully, moving along with the stones, and take the key in the next room. The most elegant way to get rid of the octopus is to lure it into the room with the millstones :-) . The key can be used to open a door in the centre room, which leads to a room containing another key. This will take you to the room next door, which leads to the pool with the giant octopus. In the pool, you should swim away from the octopus by pulling the lever on the bottom and the lever in the passage at the back. Then you can leave the pool and the other doors in the central room are open.
In the corridor system you will find another key and can use it to open the gate to the alcove containing a skeleton and a switch. The switch sets the second mill wheel in motion. The millstones blocked a switch, which can now be activated as you pass by. The gate to the exit is now open.

### Level 15 - The Mine

You are in a tunnel that is supported by wooden poles. You should not run into these carelessly, otherwise the stone slabs will fall on your head. You can extinguish the fire by shooting the lever at an angle with the crossbow...
When you reach the lorry, you can press RETURN to get in and drive off. This will allow you to cross the fire in the tunnel unscathed. If necessary, duck and slow down. However, two Anacondas are waiting at the bottom...

The exit from the large room is buried in the corner. Use the shovel to uncover the stone slabs and push them apart. You fall into the next room.

It is advisable to kill all the scorpions first. The path from the switch to the door can only be made if you run optimally and to do this you have to tip over the stone slab (e.g. with the sword). You are now on a narrow path in a cave. If you stray from the path, you will fall to your death! There is a rope dangling from the ceiling in the far corner. You have to jump up and pull on it to lower the suspension bridge. Once you have crossed the bridge, go through the door back into a tunnel. There is a key buried in the corner of the passage, the rest should be obvious...

### Level 16 - The Swamp in the Woods

First go to the campfire and take the key from the one dead fellow. Now proceed as follows: You enter a hut and find the key or switch to the next hut.

* **Hut 1 (windmill)** : Jump up to pull the lever; the ladder comes down. Climb up the ladder with the jump button and take the key.
* **Hut 2** : The key is behind the sacks of grain in a narrow gap in the wall. It can only be fished out with the shovel!
* **Hut 3** : Open the hatch to the cellar and pull the switch there. Leave the hut.
The gate to the swamp is now open. In the swamp, first go straight ahead, then left and pull the switch. This will open the gate to the hut at the other end. There are also fireballs in the swamp...

Follow the forest path and complete the level by reaching the hut.
A cutscene follows.

### Level 17 - The Wildfire

You should not leave the forest path, otherwise you will take damage. Back in the swamp, there is a narrow path past the burning ruins to the crater. Now you have to get to the opposite end of the crater by walking along the edge. However, you should take care of the spiders first. If you pass the path on the other side of the crater, a crevice opens up and you fall in...

### Level 18 - Dorgar's Lair

Follow the crevice and enter the cave. From the passage system of the cave there are cross-connections to a large room - the whereabouts of Dorgar. As soon as you enter this room, you will be followed by Dorgar. He is very large, ugly, very dangerous, moderately intelligent and cannot be defeated with weapons. You have to lure him into the next room with the mummies (which don't do anything, by the way), where the floor collapses and Dorgar falls into the depths. And if you are clumsy, you will fall too.
A strong tremor begins and the vibrations uncover the passage in the large room that was blocked by the green stones.

The following passage with the many "small" spiders is sealed at the end by a rock wall. If you hit it, you will be thrown back by a tidal wave and you can dive through the passage. Master Grant is already imprisoned in the next room. When you free him, there is a nice final sequence and the game is over :-(
