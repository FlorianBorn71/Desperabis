#++         þL The Crystal Ball
#++++þA#
       ealous young Kjarthan was 
#        for sure, zealous and determined. It has been
years that felt like ages, he has been serving his master Grant, the great
sorcerer, as a mage's apprentice - and many more were yet to come.
#+But in a time when the
world still seemed to be sleeping peacefully and carefree Kjarthan also was
full of love for the love of his life, Tin, the potter's daughter. And
whenever his studies - and his master - allowed, he visited her. One time,
when he descended from the castle, in which the old Sorcerer lived, into the village to see Tin was different and would likely change everyones fate forever.
#+On this very evening, he found Tin in a
worrying state! She looked miserable and was hardly able to talk. Coughing and fever plagued her, as did so many other people in the village.
Some villagers believed that the reason for the ominous illness was to be found in the castle that towered over the small, sleepy hamlet.
#+But Kjarthan knew better!
#+Sure, his master,
old Grant, was a great magician and he certainly had a lot of power,
but he was not to blame for the outbreak of the sinister plague!
#+
Kjarthan asked Master Grant many times to help the villagers and use his
healing skills. He was particularly concerned for Tin's welfare!

#+But Master Grant was bitter and solely devoted to his research and experiments.
Many years of disputes and arguments with the villagers had hardened and
desensitised his heart. He believed that the fate of the people in the village
was to be in their own hands and that they were responsible for themselves...


#+
Kjarthan believed otherwise! That evening, when he saw that his
beloved Tin was getting worse and worse, he decided to take
initiative himself. It was not for nothing that he had endured
the many hard years as a sorcerer's apprentice with Master Grant.
They would serve him well now! That very night, he sneaked into
his master's study. The object of his desire was a sphere of crystal
quartz, which weighed in for the good on the balance between light and
darkness and was of inestimable value for the well-being of mankind.
Its magic, which had always served Kjarthan's master so well, would
now also help him to achieve his goals...

#++         þLThe Age Of Darkness
#++++
With the orb in his hands, Kjarthan entered Tin's bedchamber. All his thoughts
and hopes centred on his beloved and the quartz sphere.
#+Full of concentration, he began to chant the spell.
##+Sweat beaded on his forehead as he spoke the magical incantations over
and over again, his hands wrapped around the sphere and his whole body trembling.
#+He had almost completed his training, but of course he lacked the experience
and wisdom needed to cast this
spell.
#+Tin reared up in pain. Arms and legs dug deep into her bedside as
groaning sounds escaped her throat. Kjarthan prayed for her wellbeing,
but she was too weak and he was not yet a full-fledged
wizard!
#+In the end, she lost the battle and her spirit left her body.
Desperate and angry, Kjarthan ran out into the open, but even the
cold night air could not ease his pain. A loud, desperate scream
escaped his throat and the reverberations carried far through the woods.
Furious with rage, he hurled the quartz sphere that had let him down to the ground.
#+It was only when he saw the broken pieces of the sphere at his feet that
he realised his mistake...
#+The balance of power had been destroyed! Due to his thoughtless anger,
the Darkness had gained the upper hand and immediately sent Dorgar, his
demon and knight of darkness. He covered the village in a black fog, taking
the people with him, causing the dead to rise from their graves, resurrecting
monsters and awakening an unquenchable thirst for blood in the animals of the area.
#+Even the neighbourhood was adapted to his wishes. But he didn't just take the
villagers with him, his attention was particularly focussed on old Grant. But he
couldn't just make him disappear like all the other people: The sorcerer's power
was too great. The demon devised a dungeon for him, far away in a hidden place!
So the village was empty and deserted, the sorcerer had disappeared and with him
the only one whose power would be enough to confront the demon and restore the
balance of
power...
#+
Only Kjarthan was spared by Dorgar, as he had freed him from the underworld -
and Kjarthan realised that the responsibility to find his master and destroy
the evil lay with him...

 þK The Castle
#                     þD
#As you enter the
#castle, you are
#engulfed in darkness
#until your torch is
#lit with a crackle
#and the surroundings are slightly
illuminated. Bare, cold walls surround you, rats scurry into the far corners
of the walls to hide in the shadows. You walk onwards, your footsteps echoing
in the old vaults.
#+The whole time you have
the unsettling feeling that someone or something is watching you. But in the
flickering glow of the flame, you only recognise shadows on the walls.
Suddenly you notice a crunching under your foot. As you look down, you
recognise the pale bones of a human hand. You look around because you
sense a movement behind you and flinch as the hand on the floor grabs
your ankle...
#
@2
You grab the lever with both hands and push against it with all your strength.
Slowly, with a creak, it gives way and the mechanism is set in motion.
The dusty cogwheels mesh and brittle ropes are tightened. Bit by bit,
the beam blocking the door gives way. At last, the entrance is open!
You open the two wings of the gold-studded door and step into the burial
chamber. Cold, stale air wafts towards you and you take careful steps
towards the stone slab of the coffin. Just don't spring a trap!
After leaning your weapon against the mossy wall, you try to push the
slab off the sarcophagus. But it's stuck! You take a moment to catch
your breath and push against it again. Only with all your strength do
you manage to move it after all. Don't stop now! You push further and
can already take a look inside the tomb. What you recognise are old
bandages, bones and a red glow in the dead man's eyes, which seems to
be getting brighter and
brighter...

Once again, you remove the sticky scraps from your face and armour.
The walls look as if they are covered in translucent grey cloth.
Unfortunately, the light from your torch doesn't reach the end of
the corridor, but there must be something there. For some time now,
you have been hearing the crunching and rustling that reaches your
ears from the deep maw of darkness. But you keep going, climbing
over ropes and taut strings. Everything sticks! Then you recognise
the end of the path and your foot bumps into a tinny object. Just
a dented helmet! In the light of your torch you recognise the former
owner. Just an emaciated figure caught in the ropes.
And yet a twitch runs through his body. It is not he himself who is moving,
but rather the ropes on which a huge body with eight hairy legs is
approaching...
#
@4
You awake! You were only able to rest for a short time. Your joints
ache as you stretch. Weapon in hand, you set about continuing your
journey through the barren vaults.
#+Your torch still
bathes the walls in a twitching play of shadow patterns and light.
Only a single shadow remains motionless, pausing on the spot as
if about to leap. You recognise the malevolent, devilish glow in
the eyes that stare at you and draw ever closer...
#^             þM
@5
You enter a huge room. However, the fresh air you
have been expecting is not there.
#++For some time now, you have been
accompanied by a pungent smell of sulphur and it doesn't go
away. On the contrary, it is steadily becoming more and more pungent.
#++Your gaze wanders around and catches on some scales covering a
colossal figure. The figure grows larger and larger, rises into the
air and straightens up.
At the same time, enormous wings spread out and a dragon-like head
turns towards you...

 þK   The Forest
#                     þE
#The rhythm of the
#pounding drums sounds
#monotonous. The green,
#opaque hell only lets
#you guess whether you
#are alone or not. The tropical air is humid and so
thick you could have cut it with a knife.
Swarms of mosquitoes leave you no peace!
Somewhere in the distance, you hear a deep rumbling,
and the slight trembling under your feet also suggests volcanic
activity. Since you left the castle walls, you have been making your way
through the strange thicket. The environment must have changed too, because
you remember this area differently.
#+The foul magic has not only
affected the vegetation, but also the life forms, you think, as a
monstrous ape lands directly from a treetop at your feet. The drumming of
fists and the roar echo through the treetops and a flock of colourful
birds take to the skies in
fright...

þL The Volcano Cave
#                     þF
#This cave seems to
#be a safe place.
#Resting at last!
#After some uneasy
#sleep and a few
#scanty provisions, you move on.
The cave seems to lead deeper into the mountain. This path seems to
bring you closer to your destination! You go deeper into the labyrinth
of passages, climb over crevices, step over ledges and occasionally have
to choose a different path. The deeper you go into the cave, the more
often you come across underground waters. Crystal-clear lakes and streams
where you quench your thirst. But gradually you feel the urge to go further.
But that also means crossing this ice-cold water. You wonder if there are
any dangerous monsters here as you set foot in the water. But you have
mastered other dangers so far...
 ~
@8
The limestones protrude from the ceiling and floor like the huge teeth of
a maw. The warm, sulphurous air suggests that underground lava, volcanic
fissures and the like are not far away. You are hungry, tired and longing
for a break to rest. But you also know that this place, with its narrow
crevices, passages and piles of rubble, is not an inviting place to linger.
Also, a constant slight shaking of the surroundings causes boulders to fall
down every now and then. Your only goal is to leave this labyrinth of caves
as soon as possible and get out into the fresh night air. But wait!
Something has just moved in front of
you...
#^             þM
@90
The shaft leads out of the cave into a lonely hut. It seems to be
a place that has been spared by the dark power, as if it were protected
by another force.
#+As you enter the only room in the hut, you notice a person standing wearily in
the corner, taking almost casual notice of you.
#+It's an old woman and you quickly realise that she must have magical abilities.
 Obviously her power was too great to be broken by Dorgar, but now she seems
exhausted and apathetic.
#+You feel the
need to tell her everything, but she interrupts you at your first
attempt. ,,What you need,ïï she continues, ,,I will sell you cheaply,
but get out of my house soon!ïï

 þL  The Cathedral
#                     þG
#Thick fog covers the
#fields. At last you
#have a clear sky over
#your head again and
#have been able to
#leave the darkness behind you. It smells of morning
dew and fresh leaves. Somewhere in the distance,
a flock of crows soars up and the ringing of a church bell
sounds erratically in the wind. You can see the thatched roofs of a few
farms and huts rising up between the rotting fields. Perhaps you can set
up camp here. A dry place and a warm meal by the fire would be just what
you need right now. Can you trust the peace? Apart from the ringing of
the bell, you also hear a hoarse barking that the wind carries over to
you from the farms...
#
@10
Pale stone faces look down at you from the gallery. Countless coloured
streaks of light from the evening sun fall through the rose window
onto the old stone altar. Not much remains of the former splendour of
the old paintings; this place has been deserted for too long. You shudder!
#+In churches you used to feel protected, safe and secure. But here it is
different - the way the empty rotten wooden benches stand in the twilight,
they remind you more of rows of graves. And the stone angels on the pillars
look like ominous messengers with their grotesque body shapes and trumpets.
Something has corrupted this place and you will not leave until you come
face to face with
it...

þL The Sewers
#                      þH
#A foul odour of mould,
#decay and death
#emanates from this
#place. Slimy,
#glistening moss
#stretches across the vaulted ceiling
like tangles of fungus. A few rats
squeak and disappear into a drainpipe as you approach them. In the
crackling flames of your torch, you recognise a fork in the path. Both
paths lead further into the darkness. You are just thinking about
which path to choose when a noise startles you. It sounds like a hiss!
It echoes in the low corridors like the lasting impression of a bad dream.
Which direction did it come from? Suddenly you hear another noise, this
time much closer. Maybe it's better to get away quickly, you think, as
you hear another
hiss.
#Your eyes scan the corridors while your thoughts search
for an escape route...
#^             þM
@12
You are still wading through the stinking corridors of the sewers.
By now you hardly notice the acrid vapours and the foul smell.
Your thoughts only revolve around completing your task. You know
you are not far from your goal. Overcoming the dangers has taken
more and more of your strength and you are tired and hungry.

þL  The Mine
#                      þI
#You finally have solid
#ground under your feet
#again. Although there
#is no end to the
#corridors and tunnels,
#it seems that hard-working hands
have been at work here. The tunnels have been secured with supports and
the rock has been cleanly excavated. It is not only the fine glitter of
the silvery veins in the rock that reveals that profitable mining was
once carried out here, you will also find other evidence of hard labour.
Broken pickaxes, rusty shovels and the odd helmet. The tracks which lead
into the darkness like an iron band are of particular interest to you.
After following them for a while, you come across a battered lorry.
Covered in cobwebs and dust, it seems to have been waiting here for your
arrival for decades.
#+This vehicle could help
you make faster progress and reach your destination soon. Hopefully
the rusty bolts and screws can withstand the strain, you think as
you climb in.
#+The brakes are squealing as you slow down to avoid hurtling towards
the wooden structure spanning the abyss at full
speed...

þK The Swamp
#                  þJ
#From the mine,
#the shaft leads
#directly into a small
#hut, where you
#find some food
#and rest for a while.
As you leave the shack,
you realise that it is deep night.
Still very dazed, at first you only notice the foul odour of the
moor. Then you see the moon, which covers the landscape in
a pale light and sparkles like diamonds in the water of the
nearby lakes. Thick fog lies over the
marshes and lakes, covering them like a white shroud.
#+You watch the clear starry sky and suddenly spot a few
shooting stars.
#+You now clearly sense the presence of your master Grant,
Dorgar's lair must be close by. You set off
immediately...~
@15
After waking from your faint and holding your aching head, you become aware
of the pungent smell. All around you, flames are leaping into the
sky and everything is shrouded in smoke.
#+The fire crackles and flickers between the fallen tree trunks. You lie
in the middle of a field of rubble that was once a tower.
#+Behind the flames and smoke, the edge of a huge crater arches menacingly
over the plain. This place seems to be the centre of devastation.
What will await me there?, you ask yourself as you set off to solve the
riddle...

          The Lair Of
#            Dorgar
#         þL
#+++
The fall into the crevice was less serious. As you search
the rock face for a way to climb up, you discover - quite
inconspicuously - the entrance to a cave.
#+All this can't be a coincidence, you think, rather you have the
feeling that you are expected...
#
@30
#    þK   The Park
##++
There is no chance of
getting inside via the main portal because it's heavily guarded.
#But you know of a secret entrance through which you can enter the castle
from the back. So you set off and enter the imposing, very ornate castle park on the
other side of the lake.
##The setting sun casts a
red-golden glow over the park. The smell of freshly cut grass fills the
air.
#+Your gaze sweeps across the green meadows and
pastures that continue to the horizon. The sight of nature makes you
forget your worries about Tin for a moment...
#
@31
You have found the secret entrance and are now in
an underground tunnel. You shiver in the damp
cold.
#+The tunnel probably runs underneath the lake behind the
castle.
#+A smell of mould and decay hits you. Tree roots stick out
from the ceiling. Only slowly do your eyes adjust to the twilight
provided by the scattered torches.
#+++#As you enter a large hall, the feeling of confinement and
enclosure subsides to some degree.
#
@32
You climb up a narrow shaft on metal rungs and reach a small station at
the bottom of the lake. When you look outside, everything seems
a little distorted through the thick panes of glass.
#You remember that Grant often
spoke of his research into the flora and fauna of the lake
and deduce that there must be a connection from this underwater
station to the castle.
#
@33
       þK  The Castle
#++++With great effort, you manage to free yourself from the
underwater vessel and enter the castle through the airlock. You have
never been in this part of the castle before...
#
@36
#++In the meantime, a thunderstorm has rolled in and dark clouds cover
the evening sky. As you open the door to the roof, a cold and wet wind
blows against you.
#
@34
#++
At last you are back inside the castle. You know that finding the
crystal will be no easy task. Grant has done everything he can to secure
the castle against intruders during his absence. You will
have to use all your experience to find the
hiding place.
But beware, danger lurks everywhere!

#++Now you are well prepared and can start the mission!

@94
#You have found the crystal ball and return to the village. You have already
lost a lot of time. The magic orb will now help you to save Tin.

       End of Part 1
#
@95
#\
Once again you think of Tin, of your mistake, of the strange places you
have seen...
#++
And you know, deep inside you, she will never die...
##
          þB ü_#
#
@96
At last, Grant is free!!! The smell of blood and death still clings to you,
because you had to overcome many dangers before you reached your
goal. Your thoughts are with Tin - and the fatal mistake you made
because of her.
#+Now you have made amends, evil has been
defeated!
#+With the destruction of the demon, the dimensional fabric can
be healed again...
#_
A grey cloudy morning dawns as you climb the ancient steps. You travel
up from the caves to a plateau that offers a view of the whole
country.
#+The old man looks tired! With slow movements, his wrinkled hands
draw magical symbols in the air. The look in his eyes flickers
under his closed eyelids. Then he begins to softly sing a hoarse
chant while his arms describe an arc towards the
sky.
#+At this moment, the cloud cover above the rocks breaks open and
a strong glow emanates from Grant. A tremor runs through the rocks
below you as the wind rises into a gale...
#+
Suddenly you are pulled off your feet. The hole in the clouds has opened
wider and Grant shines in a pillar of light. Seconds later, a second
detonation shakes the area and a wave of light and magic spreads across
the land below you. You stand in the centre on the rocky plateau and
watch as the magic dispels the darkness from the earth and closes
the dimensional rift...
