# Desperabis Desktop Player

This is a standalone executable that renders Desperabis on your Windows Desktop using a DX-11 based renderer but based on original assets.
It mimics the original rendering features such as billboarding but adds modern capabilities where necessary, e.g. real water reflections
or fully dynamic lighting.

Game code is not executed and sounds are not played. Instead, this app is just for navigating through all existing levels of Desperabis.

After starting this app, a window opens that renders the trainings level.

# Controls

Within the window, you can navigate the free camera with the `WASD` keys and look around with the mouse.
You can also use the mouse for the menu bar, where you can change the level, camera modes, and a few rendering capabilities.
